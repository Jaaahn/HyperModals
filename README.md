# HyperModals

HyperModals is a small library focused on making typical tasks like creating modals and UI notifications easy and fast.
It aims on providing an intuitive and stripped-down developer experience that allows for focusing on the task of creating a good app. You can start with the default configuration and later tweak the values to match your needs and the style of your application.

## Disclaimer

This library is still in development. Only Notifications are currently available, but I will do my best to finish the modals ASAP ðŸ™ƒ.

# Developing

2. Run live reload example server `npm run dev`
3. Build for production `npm run build`
